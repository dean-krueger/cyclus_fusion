This repo holds the work I am doing for my Masters Thesis at the University of Wisconsin Madison. The purpose of this project is to produce a cyclus model that is capable of handling fusion tritium (decay, hold up time, losses, TBR), fusion availability factor (AF) beyond just lowering the power by 1-AF, CANDUs as a tritium source, and ITER as a tritium sink. To achieve this, I will need to add capabilities to the Cyclus ecosystem to represent fusion power plants.


Included:
* Requirements.pdf -- A document outlining broad requirements for the fusion power plant archetype which will be added to Cyclus. 
* Design.txt -- A document which takes the project requirements and specifies how they are to be implemented as a Cyclus archetype. This document is much more specific than the Requirements document.
