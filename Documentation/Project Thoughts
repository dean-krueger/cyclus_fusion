The basic outline of the project I've been given is to do the FFH fuel cycle analysis proposed in Matthew's prelim. This includes:
    * Cost of reprocessing/recycling Pu in LWRs (I assume this is going to need some code other than Cyclus? TECHTEST?)
    * Political aspects (What does this mean?)
    * Siting Considerations (for the FFH systems? Is this a "consult the NRC guidelines" type issue?)
    * How do some design decisions affect market (thsi feels like the real meat of the probem):
        * Size/Burnup Rate (of FFH system? Of Fusion Reactors? Of LWRs producing the Actinide fuel?)
        * Fuel Type (Inculsion of Np vs Just Cm+Am?, how do we look at this, economically, primarily in terms of HLW 
          repository with a little bit of selling off products sprinkled in?)
        * Reprocessing Rate (reprocessing of spent LWR fuel into FFH fuel? Reprocessing of tritium into Fusion Fuel?)
        * TBR in different fusion scenarios (Market based deployment simulation like in "Huff et al. 2014"?)


Project's Major Questions:
* "How does the introduction of one or more FFH systems affect the overall fuel cycle in NA economically with respect 
   to HLW repository availability?"

or

* "How does the introduction of one or more FFH systems affect the availability of Tritium for the deployment of power 
   plant scale fusion devices in NA, compared to the current fuel cycle in which Tritium comes primarily from CANDU 
   reactors?"

Project's Minor Questions:
* "How does the introduction of one or more FFH systems affect the market for fuel reprocessing facilities, and what 
   does the cost/benefit analysis look like with respect to CAPEX of a reprocessing plant vs sale of MOX fuel + 
   secondaries?"
* "What does the major quesiton's answer look like over a parametric study of the four qualities listed above (Size/
   Burnup rate, Fuel Type, Reprocessing Rate, and TBR in different fusion scenarios)?"





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project Goal (Minimum Viable Product):
* Produce a cyclus model that is capable of handling Tritium (Decay, Hold Up Time, Losses, TBR), Fusion Availability 
  Factor (beyond just lowering the power by 1-AF), CANDUs as a Tritium source, and ITER as a Tritium sink. 

    * Will likely need to introduce a new "Fusion" Facility which is tied to a tritium "Storage" facility like the 
      commodity converter facility from "Extensions to the CYCLUS Ecosystem in Support of Market-Driven Transition 
      Capability" (Huff et al. 2014)
        * Fusion Facility will request tritium from the storage facility preferentially, storage facility will request
          it from the broader market
        * Storage may need to "manually" decay the tritium
            * Is this reasonable? Does tritium live anywhere else for long periods of time which makes this invalid?
        * Fusion Facility will need to implement the TBR as one of its variables. It should request trtium from storage
          and then return tritium equal to T_requested * TBR to storage. 
        * Storage may need to offload excess tritium when it reaches some threshold? Maybe the Institution builds a new
          fusion reactor whenever there's enough excess, or alternatively we implement some sort of long-term non-
          linked storage facility for extra T?

Project Goal (Sucessful Product):
* Use the cyclus model from the MVP to make a model of the expansion of fusion power with respect to things like TBR, 
  CANDU breeding.
* Answer: How many CANDUs do you need to support a Fusion fleet of N GW of installed capacity?

Project Goal (Stretch Goal):
* Can we use the FFH to boost the fusion Fuel Cycle as modeled in the Sucessful Product goal?



Potentially Useful Inputs for the Fusion System wrt tritium:
    * Tritium Burn Rate (kg/day)
        * Do we want to break this out into burn fraction * fueling efficiency * Injection rate? Probably not?
            * Are these values useful elsewhere?
            * Reserve inventory required is reserve time * fraction of supply chain out / Injection rate...
            * I think this is too complicated. We want to be able to play around with different reserve sizes, and 
              leave it to the operator to ensure that their numbers are physical. 
    * Reserve Time (h)
        * Tritium Burn Rate and Reserve Time combine to make Tritium Reserve Storage (kg)
    * Tritium Start-up inventory (How much tritium do you need on hand to start a reactor as a function of power?)
    * Tritium Breeding Ratio
    * Power?
